* Introduction

We are getting away from GitHub CI, and hosting our own CI servers. From GitHub, once a person makes a push, we'll be using [[https://github.com/adnanh/webhook][webhook]] to initiate laminar.


First install laminar (use the appropriate binary):

: wget https://github.com/adnanh/webhook/releases/download/2.8.0/webhook-linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar xf webhook-linux-amd64.tar.gz
